Data Analysis of the Electric Vehicles Population with Python
#Analysis
Introduction
This report analyzes the electric vehicle (EV) market in the United States between 2014 and 2023. The analysis is based on a dataset from
Kaggle which contains information about electric vehicles registered with the Department of Licensing (DOL).
Data Exploration and Preprocessing
The dataset was explored to identify the number of rows and columns, data types of each column, and missing or duplicated values. The data
was preprocessed by removing missing values and converting the electric range column from miles to kilometers.

Data Analysis
Market Size and Growth: The total number of electric vehicles registered with the DOL increased signi cantly between 2014 and 2023.
Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) have shown a more substantial growth trend compared to Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).
Top EV Makers: The top 5 EV makers based on the number of registered vehicles are:
Tesla
Nissan
Chevrolet
Ford
BMW
 
Geographic Distribution:
The top 5 states with the highest number of registered EVs are:
Washington
California
Texas
Florida
New York
King County in Washington has the highest number of EV registrations among all counties.
Seattle, Bellevue, and Redmond are the top 3 cities with the highest number of registered EVs.
 
Electric Range:
The average electric range of BEVs is higher than that of PHEVs.
The average electric range of both types has increased over the years.
 
Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility:
A large percentage of EVs are eligible for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) bene ts.
Both BEVs and PHEVs are eligible for CAFV benets.
 
Conclusion
The electric vehicle market in the United States has experienced signi cant growth in the past decade. BEVs are becoming increasingly popular,
and the average electric range of EVs is improving.

Recommendations
Further research could be conducted to analyze the factors driving the growth of the EV market.
Investigate the impact of government policies and incentives on EV adoption.
Analyze the charging infrastructure availability and its impact on EV adoption.
